Ingredients
-----------
* 1 lb soy beans
* water
* sugar (optional)

Preparation
-----------
Soak soybeans in water overnight. Then drain the water and mix the wet soybeans with new water at ratio 2:1 water:soybeans. Put in blender for ~1min. Then strain the blended mixture through a coarse strainer. Throw away the stuff that doesn't make it through. Next do a fine straining through a cheese cloth or used sock. It is important that all grainy substances are filtered out in this process because this pulp releases a foul-smelling compound when cooked, and is unpleasant to swallow.

Once you have a nice creamy liquid with no particulates, place into a large pot and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Boil for 10 minutes, still stirring occasionally.

Remove pot from heat, add sugar if desired, and let cool. To remove any goopy film that forms on the top, strain once again into a serving container and refrigerate.
