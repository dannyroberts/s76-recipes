Preparation
-----------
Get the regular kind of kimchi, chop into, say, 2cm pieces. If you can't handle too spicy things, you can wash off the kimchi a little (actually, if you can't handle spicy things, you shouldn't make this). Cut up the pork belly into, say, 3cm pieces. Put Korean chili flakes, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, cooking wine, sugar, and pepper into a bowl with the pork (for ratio, 	6:9:4 for chili flakes, soy sauce, and sugar, the rest should be in small amounts). Chop up onions into quarter-circle arcs, and scallions into largish pieces. Put some cooking oil in a pan, put in the marinated pork and kimchi and fry (pork and kimchi roughly 1:1). Then put in the onions and scallions and fry more. Put in some sesame oil and sesame seeds. Cook tofu in boiling water (ratio of tofu to (kimchi+pork) should be 1:1). Cut into rectangular pieces. Serve together.
