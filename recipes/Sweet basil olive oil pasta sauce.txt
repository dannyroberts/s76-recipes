Ingredients
-----------
* 1 onion
* 2 cloves garlic
* sweet basil, dried
* olive oil
* salt
* corn (optional)
* shrimp (optional)

Preparation
-----------
Slice garlic into thin slices and lightly fry them in a panful of olive oil. Stay with medium heat or lower as you do not want the garlic to burn. Add sliced onions, corn and a good amount of basil. Cook until the onions become soft, and add salt. You should defrost corn and shrimp.

Improvised by Keisuke circa Fall 2008. A combination of ingredients resulting in surprising sweetness.

Note: Frying garlic slices in olive oil is often the first step in making pasta sauce. For example, peperoncino, the simplest of all pasta sauce, only requires olive oil, garlic and small, whole-dried red peppers.
