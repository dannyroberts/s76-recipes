Ingredients
-----------
* Portabello mushrooms
* Feta cheese (preferably from cow or goat)
* Olive oil
* Balsamic vinegar

Preparation
-----------
Wash the mushrooms and peel them a bit to look nice (if you want). Mix olive oil and balsamic vinegar at a 1:1 ratio and place in an existing bowl. Brush the back sides of the mushrooms with the oil-vinegar mixture, and place them on a baking sheet. Broil said back side for 4 minutes; then remove the mushrooms carefully and flip them over. Brush the front side with the oil-vinegar mixture, and crumble the feta cheese on as well. Broil for 3 minutes or until done!
