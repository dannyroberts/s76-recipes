Ingredients
-----------
* Sweet potato
* Cinnamon
* Nutmeg
* Ground gloves
* Ground ginger

Preparation
-----------
Slice the sweet potato in pieces 1-2 cm thick. Put the slices on a baking sheet and cover liberally with the spices, especially cinnamon. Bake at some reasonable temperature (375 F?) for reasonable time. Longer baking will cause them to get softer-- it's up to you, but I bet 20 mins would be fine.
