Ingredients
-----------
* 4-5 sweet potatoes (commonly confused with yamsâ€¦ whatever)
* Cinnamon
* Nutmeg
* Ground gloves
* Ground ginger

Preparation
-----------
Slice the sweet potato in pieces 1-2 cm in thickness. Brush both sides lightly with oil and put them on an (existing) baking sheet. Sprinkle them  liberally with the spices, especially cinnamon ([cinnamon] > [nutmeg] > [cloves] >> [ginger]). Bake at some reasonable temperature (375 F?) for reasonable time (25 min?). Longer baking will cause them to get softer-- it's up to you!
