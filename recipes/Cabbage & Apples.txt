Ingredients
-----------
* 1 red cabbage
* 1 large onion
* 3 apples (usually green, but red works too)
* bay leaves
* black pepper
* sugar OR honey
* lemon juice

Preparation
___________
Saute onion until golden. Add cabbage and mix. Add bay leaves and let cook until tender (~20 min). Cut apples (peeling is optional) and add them, along with the lemon juice and sugar to taste. Let simmer for a bit longer, and them remove the bay leaves. Add black pepper to taste.

Note: I have tried adding the apples near the beginning and it also came out fine.
