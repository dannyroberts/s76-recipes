Ingredients
-----------
* 2 tablespoons of butter
* 2 cups parsnips, peeled and diced (can replace one with a sweet potato)
* 1 cup chopped onion
* 1 cup peeled and diced Yukon Gold potatoes
* 4 cups stock (I used one tetra pack - 1L - of Campell's Vegetable Stock)
* 1 tablespoon wasabi paste
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* Salt and freshly ground pepper

Preparation
-----------
Heat butter in soup pot over medium heat. Add parsnips, onions and potatoes and sauté for approximately 4 minutes (until they are shiny).

Add stock, wasabi paste and soy sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for approximately 12 to 15 minutes or until vegetables are soft.

Pour soup into a blender or use a hand blender and purée until smooth.

Note! I find that if you put hot soup in a blender, it blows up everywhere! I just got a hand blender for Christmas (the type that you can immerse in a pot of soup) and it's excellent, and great for creamy soups and smoothies.

Serves 4-6.
