-----------
* 3 cups greek yogurt
* 3 small cucumbers
* Garlic
* 1 lemon's juice

* 1 tbsp fresh dill (mint also ok) 
* 1 pinch black pepper
* 1 food processor

Preparation
-----------
Peel cucumbers, then cut in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Slice cucumbers and salt them. Let it sit for a bit, then drain well. 

Place the cucumbers, garlic, lemon juice, and dill in the food processor with a bit of black pepper and some salt. After processing, stir into yogurt. Not that chopping with a knife would also work instead of food processing.
