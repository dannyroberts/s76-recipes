Ingredients
-----------
* Dark chocolate bars
* Matzot
* Sweet wine

Preparation
-----------
Melt the chocolate gently in the microwave or on the stove. While that's going on, soak the matzo in wine (max 1 minute). To assemble the cake, place a wine-soaked matzo on a plate, spread chocolate all over the matzo, top with another wine-soaked matzo, spread more chocolate on the top matzo, and so on. You can make as many layers as you like, but seven is the best. Let it sit in the fridge for a while, it tastes better that way.
