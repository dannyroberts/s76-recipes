Add flour, sugar, salt, dry yeast dissolved in water, water, milk to the rice cooker bowl. Mix it. Knead it in the bowl. Then add the butter in the center. Fold the dough into the butter. Knead it some more, thoroughly. When it no longer feels sticks, shape it so that it's round. Leave it in a warm place for 60 minutes in the bowl (this is the primary fermentation-- it should rise). Get rid of the extra gas. Don't grind it with your first. Instead, drop it from height of 50cm. Leave it in there for another 60 minutes-- this is the secondary fermentation. Switch on the rice cooker. After about 60 minutes in the rice cooker so that one side will be baked. Turn it over and cook it again. When it's done, turn it over and cook it AGAIN. Once you've cooked it 3 times in total, you're done! Just a little work, and you can have a freshly baked, fluffy fluffy Japan #2. It takes a little time, but if you want to eat a delicious and fresh bread, something like this isn't very much, right? Adding green tea or eggs to suit your taste isn't a bad idea, either. It's really and absolutely delicious.
