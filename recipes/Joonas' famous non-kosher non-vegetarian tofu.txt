Ingredients
-----------
* Firm tofu
* Bacon
* Soy sauce
* Honey

Preparation
-----------
Add some honey and soy sauce to an existing pan. Slice the tofu and wrap the slices in bacon, enough to go around at least once but at most twice (suggestion: 1.5 times). Start frying them with the double-bacon side down. Flip them over after a while. Fry until crisp. Serve hot.
