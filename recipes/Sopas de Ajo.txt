Ingredients
-----------
* About ½ a loaf of hard (old) bread
* 7 garlic cloves
* 1 tablespoon of sweet paprika
* ½ red bell pepper, peeled and cut into tiny pieces to form a paste (choricero pepper in the original recipe)
* 6 eggs
* Extra virgin olive oil
* Salt

For the broth:

* 3 leeks
* 1 carrot
* 7 garlic cloves
* A pinch of fresh parsley
* 2 L of water
* Salt

Preparation
-----------
Clean the vegetables for the broth (don’t cut them), add salt, bring them to a quick boil and let them simmer covered at low-heat for a minimum of 1 h.

Line the bottom of a pot with olive oil, and add the garlic cloves (peeled and cut into quarters). Cut the bread into very thin slices and add them to the fried garlic. Add the paprika and let cook for a bit, stirring continuously. 

Add the pepper and the strained broth (without the vegetables). Add salt to taste and stir until the bread dissolves. Let simmer for at least 20 minutes.

Right before eating it, add the raw eggs and stir until they become blended with the soup.
