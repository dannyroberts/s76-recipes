Ingredients
-----------
* Chicken
* Potatoes
* Carrots
* Onions
* Scallions
* Korean hot pepper paste (Gochujang)
* Korean chili flakes
* Soy sauce
* Cooking wine (optional)
* Garlic
* Sugar
* Pepper (optional)

Preparation
-----------
Wash the chicken. If the pieces are large, cut them into smaller pieces (but not too small). Cut potatoes, carrots, onions, and scallions into desired size (shouldn't be too small). For six chicken legs (without the thighs), I used 4 potatoes, 1 large carrot, 1 onion, and 1 stalk/bundle of scallions. Separately, put 2 tablespoons of Korean hot pepper paste, 2 tablespoons of Korean chili flakes, 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of cooking wine, 1 tablespoon of garlic, and 1 tablespoon of sugar. I think the amounts are pretty flexible. Get around 3 cups of water in a pot, boil, put in everything, boil until everything is cooked and the stew starts becoming thick. Serve over rice.
