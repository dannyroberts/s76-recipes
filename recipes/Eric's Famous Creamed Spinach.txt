Ingredients
-----------
* Lots of (chopped) spinach (Probably 1 kg for our setting)
* Cream or half&half (500 mL should be enough for 1 kg of spinach)
* Shallots or onions (A quarter to a third of an onion or equivalent volume of shallots)
* Butter (1 to 2 tablespoons(?))
* Garlic
* Salt, pepper
* Nutmeg, Parmesan cheese (optional)

Preparation
-----------
Boil spinach for a few minutes. Drain as much water as reasonably possible. Chop the spinach as much as possible --- just keep chopping. Get a pan on medium heat, put in some butter, minced garlic, and the shallots/onions. When it starts to smell good, put in the hard-core-chopped spinach and a cup of cream/half&half. Start with one teaspoon of salt, pepper, and nutmeg each. Stir. Keep tasting and put in some reasonable amounts of cream, shallots/onions, garlic, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and cheese as desired. Who knows if this is the best way to make creamed spinach? Not me, but there it is.
