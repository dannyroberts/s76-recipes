Ingredients
-----------
* 1 unbaked salmon
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1/3 cup vegetable oil XOR olive oil
* 1/4 cup juice of lemon
* 1-2 tsp sauce of soy
* 1 tsp sauce of Worcestershire
* 2 tablespoons minced parsley
* dry or fresh basil leaves
* dried oregano
* ground pepper OR salt

Preparation
-----------
Knife the salmon in several places so that the marinade can seep in. Mix everything except for the salmon, and then put the mixture onto the salmon, especially into the knife-induced incisions. Leave for 30 mins. Place the unbaked salmon on a baking sheet (skin down) and leave it in the oven until it is a baked salmon. This should take about 15 minutes at 375-400 F, but don't overcook.
