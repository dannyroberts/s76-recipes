Ingredients
-----------
* 2 lb dry black beans.
* Lots of water
* 2 or 3 bay leaves
* 1 onion
* 3 cloves garlic
* Olive oil

Preparation
-----------
Soak beans for an few hours in advance. This greatly reduces cooking time. If you forget to soak the beans, that's fine, it just takes longer to cook.

Wash black beans and then combine in a pot with bay leaves and lots of water. Five inches above the beans usually works. Bring to a boil and turn to medium heat to boil until the individual beans are soft. This can take 1-2 hours if pre-soaked, otherwise up to 4.

Chop onions and garlic and fry in olive oil until onions are clearish. Add saut√©ed onions and garlic to the beans and pour in the olive oil you used as well. Add salt to taste and continue simmering until ready to serve.

Serve on top of rice.
